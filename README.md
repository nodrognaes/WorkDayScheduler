# Work-Day-Scheduler

## What it is:

This is a simple workday scheduler in which the user can input tasks by the hour in which they occur.

## How to use:

The user will be able to input daily tasks and save them to the scheduler by clicking the Save button. Timeslots will appear greyed out, red, or green based on if it is after, during, or before the current hour. Input items will still appear upon page refresh.
